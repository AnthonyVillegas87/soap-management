# SOAP Web Services for Course Management Application

This project is focused on implementing SOAP Web Services for a course management application. It follows a contract-first approach, where the requests and responses are defined using XML Schema Definition (XSD). The project covers various SOAP concepts such as WSDL (SOAP Header, SOAP Body, and SOAP Fault), as well as XSD and JAXB (Java API for XML Binding).

## Technologies Used

- Spring (Dependency Management)
- Spring Web Services
- Spring Boot
- Spring Security (Authentication and Authorization)
- Maven (Dependencies Management)
- IntelliJ (IDE)
- Wizdler (SOAP Services Chrome Plugin)
- Tomcat Embedded Web Server

## Installation

To set up and run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Install the necessary software or dependencies mentioned above.
2. Configure the project dependencies using Maven.
3. Import the project into IntelliJ or your preferred IDE.
4. Make any necessary configuration changes, such as database connection details or security settings.

## Usage

The SOAP Web services implemented in this project provide functionality for managing courses. To use the services, you can send SOAP requests and receive SOAP responses. Here is an example of a SOAP request and response:

```
SOAP Request:
<soapenv:Envelope xmlns:soapenv="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/" xmlns:cm="http://example.com/course-management">
   <soapenv:Header/>
   <soapenv:Body>
      <cm:GetCourseRequest>
         <cm:courseId>123</cm:courseId>
      </cm:GetCourseRequest>
   </soapenv:Body>
</soapenv:Envelope>

SOAP Response:
<soapenv:Envelope xmlns:soapenv="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/" xmlns:cm="http://example.com/course-management">
   <soapenv:Header/>
   <soapenv:Body>
      <cm:GetCourseResponse>
         <cm:course>
            <cm:courseId>123</cm:courseId>
            <cm:title>Introduction to Programming</cm:title>
            <cm:instructor>John Doe</cm:instructor>
         </cm:course>
      </cm:GetCourseResponse>
   </soapenv:Body>
</soapenv:Envelope>
```

Please note that authentication and authorization may be required for certain operations. Refer to the project's security configuration for more details.

## Project Structure

The project follows a modular structure with various packages or modules. Here is a brief overview of the project structure:

- `src/main/java`: Contains the Java source code for the SOAP Web services and other components.
- `src/main/resources`: Contains configuration files, such as Spring configuration, XSD files, and WSDL files.

## Exception Handling

Exception handling is implemented in the SOAP Web services to handle any errors or exceptional situations. Custom exception classes may be used, and they are mapped to SOAP Faults to provide meaningful error messages to clients.

## Security

Basic security measures are implemented in the project using WS Security. Authentication and authorization mechanisms are in place to ensure secure access to the SOAP Web services. Refer to the project's security configuration for more details on how to configure and use security features.

## Contributing

Contributions to the project are welcome. If you encounter any issues, have feature requests, or would like to contribute code, please follow the standard process of submitting bug reports, feature requests, or pull requests.
